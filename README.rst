=========================================
"Web Scraping with Scrapy" Companion Code
=========================================

This is the companion code for the article "Web Scraping with Scrapy" published
in the March issue of Digit.

This code is best used as a reference when writing your own project. Avoid
copy-pasting the code. Instead try to follow the instructions in the article
and refer to the code if you feel something is not working as expected.

This project is organised in separate branches for each step taken in the
article, with a few extra comments thrown in. You should see dropdown showing
**"Branch: master"** in the GitHub UI that you can use to switch branches.

The default branch will show a freshly-created scrapy project, the result of
running:

.. code-block:: bash

	scrapy startproject github
